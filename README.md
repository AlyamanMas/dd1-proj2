# Introduction
This repository stores the files of the second project for the Digital Design I course with Dr. Mohamed Shaalan during the Fall 2023 semester at the American University in Cairo.

It stores a Verilog implementation of an 8x8 sequential multiplier with a 7-segment display for the Basys-3 FPGA (constraint file `main.xdc` included). It also includes an incomplete Logisim implementation (the display mechanism is missing).

`Main.v` is the top-level Verilog module.
